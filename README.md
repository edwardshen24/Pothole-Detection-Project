# Overview

Pothole Detection lets users upload images of potholes which then get recognized by OpenAI Vision and put on a map to inform users of better routes, as well as encouraging city governments to view the maps so they know the roads to fix. 


# Sustainable Development
Our program addresses UN SDG: INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE Section 9, and we are specifically focused on target 9.1 " Target Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all"

# Problems with Potholes
- Potholes cost drivers in the state of California over $3 billion a year due to damages.
- Potholes can impede traffic, increase commute times, and damage cars.

# Solution and Usage
We wanted to develop a program that lets users effortlessly report potholes so that they can be seen by other drivers as well as city governments. All the user has to do is upload an image of a pothole and the program does the rest from there. Ideally the picture is best taken from a phone but if the user is in a car, it is advised that the image is captured through a dashcam or if the car has built-in video recorders like a Tesla, those can also be used. 

# Disclaimer
Users should not upload any images that contain private information or any other information they don't wish to share with the world. Users should also be mindful of their surroundings when taking pictures of potholes and always be vigilant as to not get hurt.
